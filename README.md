# contao-real-estate-manager
Contao Module to manage real estate objects in the Backend and show them as a Page/ a List or a slider

# Note
This module is alpha at best. It is a port of a module written in my study times and need general overhaul to be used anywhere else than in my specific Contao instance.

# Special thanks
